                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a junior studying Computer Systems Engineering at Arizona State University with a focus on 
                    aerospace and embedded systems. I have a solid background in C/C++, microcontroller development,
                     and digital circuit design. I’ve worked on projects involving real-time operating systems, communication 
                     protocols, and low power radio. I’m excited to bring my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to 
                     new projects in computer engineering.</p>

                        <h3>ASU ASCEND High Altitude Balloon</h3>
                        <p>ASCEND is a project origanized by <a href="https://spacegrant.arizona.edu/">Arizona Space Grant</a> and 
                            <a href="https://www.ansr.org/">Arizona Near Space Research</a> in which student-led teams work each semester 
                            to develop payloads for a high altitude balloon launch. Currently, I am the ASU ASCEND's Software Team Lead, in charge of 
                            developing the software for the payload running on a Pi Pico. ASCEND has been an amazing project to develop 
                            leadership skills and explore embedded systems. Through this project I had the opportunity to implement parallel processing 
                            systems using the RP2040's dual core processor, enable radio communication with custom ground station software and packeting,  
                            develop an ATtiny85 based watchdog system, and much more. I've also had the opportunity to led a team of 6 software engineers and
                            hone my project and codebase management skills.

                        <h3>Coconut CubeSat</h3>
                        <p>The <a href="https://interplanetary.asu.edu/coconut/">Coconut CubeSat</a> is a project of ASU's Sun Devil Satellite Lab and Interplanetary Initiative Lab in partnership with NASA's CubeSat 
                            Launch Initiative. Currently, I am the Software Team Lead for the project, responsible for organizing a team of 7 software developers to 
                            write code for the onboard ARM-based RP2040 using the Pico C/C++ SDK and FreeRTOS. In my time on the project I have developed I2C drivers 
                            for various onboard sensors, designed a FreeRTOS task for handling LoRa radio communication, and worked closely with the electrical team 
                            to ensure the hardware is compatible with the different components the software interacts with.  </p>

                        <h3>TriSept/RocketStar Payload</h3>
                        <p>During my time as a member of the BYU Spacecraft Club I had the opportunity to work as the principle software engineer for a payload developed
                            in collaboration with <a href="https://trisept.com/">TriSept</a> to be flown on a <a href="https://rocketstar.nyc/">RocketStar</a> Cowbell rocket. 
                            The Raspberry Pi 0-based payload was designed to record the conditions of the flight from inside the nose and was developed in MicroPython so that
                            it could test TSEL, a security-focused Linux distribution developed by TriSept for use on satellites.

                        <h3>Ground Stations</h3>
                        <p>As I've done payload flight software I've often needed to build and operate various ground station systems, often independently of the project as the ability 
                        to work as a part of network receiving data from planes or satellites was something that is exciting. Because of this I currently operate a 
                        <a href="https://tinygs.com/station/SnailStation@8015308104">TinyGS Station</a> and a <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/stats/user/tylernielsenn">PiAware Station</a>,
                        and in my work at BYU as a part of the Spacecraft Club I helped to build their <a href="https://network.satnogs.org/stations/3086/">SatNOGS Station</a>.</p>
